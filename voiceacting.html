		<h1>My Voice acting</h1>
		<div id="voiceacting">
		<p>As a budding indie games designer its important to have a plethora of skills that can be useful to your studio.
		From a young age I have been quite talented with my voice, whether that be doing character voices and creature noises or narration,
		I’ve even been known to sing from time to time (thought I won’t be posting that here).

		<h2> Disembodied</h2>
		<div id="voiceacting">
			<p> 
			The disembodied audio drama project was the first voice acting work that I took part in. 
			Playing several voices	including the zombie scream, the panicked male and the caution warning at the beginning,
			it was a fun experience to take on and to see the project come to fruition. the following audio is the project in its finished state,
			with thanks to Natasha Monica Barba-Castagnaro the producer, director and editor of the project.

		<h2>Missed call </h2>
		<div id="voiceacting">
			<p> 
				As the second voice work ive done I had a more prominent role to play. the full clip is below this paragraph. I enjoyed working on 
				this more fleshed out role alot and its actually what helped me to know I could have a future in VO. Special thanks 
				to Raquel Nachimento-Sousa for casting, producing, directing and recording this project and giving me the file to show you all here.
